### Q. What is JavaScript and what are its key features?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. It was originally developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995 and has since become the cornerstone of front-end web development, while also extending to server-side (via Node.js), mobile apps, and even desktop applications. What makes JavaScript truly powerful is its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) in browsers, enabling real-time updates without page reloads.

Key features include:
- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables don't need explicit type declarations; types are determined at runtime, which speeds up development but requires careful handling to avoid errors.

- **Object-Oriented and Functional Paradigms**: It supports prototypes for inheritance, closures, and higher-order functions, allowing for flexible and modular code.

- **Asynchronous Programming**: Built-in support for callbacks, Promises, and async/await makes it ideal for handling non-blocking operations like API calls or event handling.

- **Event-Driven**: JavaScript thrives in environments like browsers where it responds to user interactions (e.g., clicks, scrolls) via event listeners.

- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on any device with a JavaScript engine, such as V8 in Chrome or SpiderMonkey in Firefox.

- **Extensive Ecosystem**: With libraries like React, Vue, and Angular, it's evolved into a full-stack language.

### Q. What is the difference between JavaScript and Java?

This is a common misconception due to the similar names, but JavaScript and Java are fundamentally different languages with distinct origins and uses. JavaScript was named "JavaScript" as a marketing ploy to capitalize on Java's popularity in the 90s, but that's where the similarity ends.

- **Syntax and Paradigm**: Java is a statically-typed, class-based object-oriented language, requiring compilation to bytecode. JavaScript is dynamically-typed, prototype-based, and interpreted (or just-in-time compiled in modern engines).

- **Execution Environment**: Java runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it platform-independent but requiring a runtime. JavaScript primarily runs in browsers or Node.js environments without needing a separate VM.

- **Use Cases**: Java is often used for enterprise-level backend systems, Android apps, and large-scale applications (e.g., via Spring framework). JavaScript dominates web development, both client-side (interactivity) and server-side (Node.js for APIs).

- **Typing and Error Handling**: Java enforces strict types at compile-time, catching errors early. JavaScript's loose typing allows more flexibility but can lead to runtime errors if not managed well.

- **Concurrency**: Java uses multi-threading for parallelism, while JavaScript is single-threaded with an event loop for concurrency.

In short, if you're building a robust backend service, Java might be your go-to, but for web interactivity, JavaScript is unmatched. They're like distant cousinsâ€”sharing some syntax inspirations but living in different worlds.

### Q. What are the primitive data types in JavaScript?

JavaScript has seven primitive data types, which are the building blocks of the language. Primitives are immutable and passed by value, unlike objects which are passed by reference. According to the [ECMAScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Data_structures) specification, they are:

1. **String**: Represents a sequence of characters, e.g., `"Hello, World!"`.
2. **Number**: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers, e.g., `42` or `3.14`.
3. **BigInt**: Represents integers with arbitrary precision, e.g., `9007199254740991n`.
4. **Boolean**: Represents a logical entity and can have two values: `true` and `false`.
5. **Undefined**: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value is of type `undefined`.
6. **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
7. **Symbol**: Introduced in ES6, represents a unique and immutable value, often used as object property keys.

### Q. What is the difference between == and === operators?

The `==` (loose equality) and `===` (strict equality) operators both compare values, but the key difference lies in type coercion. The key differences between them are:

1. **Type Coercion**:
   - **`==` (Loose Equality)**: Performs type coercion before comparison. If types differ, JavaScript converts one to match the other. For example, "5" == 5 returns `true` because the string is coerced to a number. This can lead to unexpected results, like `false == 0` being `true`.
   
   - **`===` (Strict Equality)**: Compares both value and type without coercion. So, `"5" === 5` is `false` because one is a string and the other a number. It's safer and more predictable.



2. **Use Cases**:
   - Use `==` when you want to compare values for equality, regardless of their type.
   - Use `===` when you want to ensure that both the value and type are the same.

### Examples:

```javascript
console.log(5 == '5');   // true (type coercion occurs)
console.log(5 === '5');  // false (different types)

console.log(null == undefined);  // true (type coercion occurs)
console.log(null === undefined); // false (different types)
```

In general, it's recommended to use `===` to avoid unexpected behavior due to type coercion.

### Q. What does NaN stand for, and how can you check if a value is NaN?

NaN stands for "Not a Number," which is a special value in the Number type representing an invalid or unrepresentable numeric result, like the square root of a negative number or 0 / 0.

To check if a value is NaN, you can use the `isNaN()` function or the `Number.isNaN()` method. However, it's important to note that `isNaN()` has some quirks, as it will coerce non-numeric values to numbers before checking. Therefore, it's generally recommended to use `Number.isNaN()` for a more reliable check.

### Examples:

```javascript
console.log(isNaN(NaN));          // true
console.log(isNaN('Hello'));      // true (coerced to NaN)
console.log(isNaN(42));           // false

console.log(Number.isNaN(NaN));          // true
console.log(Number.isNaN('Hello'));      // false (no coercion)
console.log(Number.isNaN(42));           // false
```

In summary, NaN is a unique value in JavaScript that indicates an invalid number, and you can use `Number.isNaN()` for accurate checks.



## Solution 6

### Q. What is the difference between undefined and null?

Both represent absence of value, but they serve different purposes:

- **Undefined**: Indicates a variable has been declared but not assigned a value, or a missing object property or function argument. It's the default for uninitialized variables (e.g., `let x; console.log(x); // undefined`). It's a primitive type.

- **Null**: An intentional assignment meaning "no value" or "empty object reference." It's often used to explicitly clear a variable (e.g., `let y = null;`). Interestingly, `typeof null` returns `"object"` due to a historical bug in JavaScript.

**Key difference**: Undefined is automatic (absence by default), null is deliberate (absence by choice). In JSON, null is supported, but undefined isn't. For best practices, use null for intentional resets and check with strict equality to avoid mixing them up.



### Examples:

```javascript
let a;
console.log(a);          // undefined (not initialized)
console.log(typeof a);   // "undefined"

let b = null;
console.log(b);          // null (intentionally empty)
console.log(typeof b);   // "object"
```

In summary, use `undefined` when a variable has not been assigned a value, and use `null` when you want to explicitly indicate no value.



## Solution 7
*Reference: [Question 7](js-questions.md#question-7)*

### Q. How do you check if a variable is undefined?

To check if a variable is undefined:

**Use strict equality**: `if (variable === undefined) { ... }`. This is precise and avoids coercion.

**Alternatively**, `typeof variable === "undefined"`, which works even if the variable isn't declared (avoids ReferenceError).

Avoid loose checks like if `(!variable)` because falsy values (e.g., 0, "") would also trigger it.

In modern code, optional chaining (`?`) or nullish coalescing (`??`) can handle undefined gracefully, like `value ?? 'default`'. This ensures code resilience, especially in APIs where data might be missing.



## Solution 8
*Reference: [Question 8](js-questions.md#question-8)*

### Q. What is the typeof operator, and what values does it return?

The `typeof` operator is used to determine the type of a given variable or value in JavaScript. It returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.

### Possible return values:

- `"undefined"`: If the variable is not assigned a value.
- `"boolean"`: If the variable is a boolean.
- `"number"`: If the variable is a number.
- `"bigint"`: If the variable is a bigint.
- `"symbol"`: If the variable is a symbol.
- `"string"`: If the variable is a string.
- `"object"`: If the variable is an object (including arrays and null).
- `"function"`: If the variable is a function.

### Examples:

```javascript
console.log(typeof undefined);    // "undefined"
console.log(typeof true);         // "boolean"
console.log(typeof 42);           // "number"
console.log(typeof 42n);         // "bigint"
console.log(typeof Symbol());    // "symbol"
console.log(typeof "Hello");     // "string"
console.log(typeof { name: "Alice" }); // "object"
console.log(typeof [1, 2, 3]);   // "object" (arrays are objects)
console.log(typeof null);        // "object" (historical bug)
console.log(typeof function() {}); // "function"
```

In summary, the `typeof` operator is a useful tool for checking the type of a variable or value in JavaScript.



## Solution 9
*Reference: [Question 9](js-questions.md#question-9)*

### Q. Explain type coercion in JavaScript with examples.

Type coercion in JavaScript refers to the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another. This can happen in various scenarios, such as during comparisons, arithmetic operations, or when using certain operators. JavaScript is a loosely typed language, which means it allows for flexible type conversions, but this can sometimes lead to unexpected results.

### Examples:

1. **String and Number Coercion**:
   ```javascript
   console.log("5" + 3); // "53" (string concatenation)
   console.log("5" - 3); // 2 (string is coerced to number)
   ```

2. **Boolean Coercion**:
   ```javascript
   console.log(true + 1); // 2 (true is coerced to 1)
   console.log(false + 1); // 1 (false is coerced to 0)
   ```

3. **Equality Coercion**:
   ```javascript
   console.log(0 == "0"); // true (string is coerced to number)
   console.log(0 === "0"); // false (no coercion, different types)
   ```

4. **Null and Undefined Coercion**:
   ```javascript
   console.log(null == undefined); // true (both are treated as "empty")
   console.log(null === undefined); // false (different types)
   ```

In summary, while type coercion can be useful, it can also lead to bugs if not properly understood. It's often recommended to use strict equality (`===`) to avoid unintended coercion.



## Solution 10
*Reference: [Question 10](js-questions.md#question-10)*

### Q. What are falsy values in JavaScript?

Falsy values are values that evaluate to `false` when encountered in a Boolean context. In JavaScript, the following values are considered falsy:

1. `false`: The Boolean value false.
2. `0`: The number zero.
3. `-0`: The negative zero.
4. `0n`: The BigInt zero.
5. `""`: An empty string.
6. `null`: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
7. `undefined`: A variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
8. `NaN`: Represents a value that is not a number.

### Examples:

```javascript
if (!false) {
    console.log("This is false");
}

if (!0) {
    console.log("This is zero");
}

if (!"") {
    console.log("This is an empty string");
}

if (!null) {
    console.log("This is null");
}

if (!undefined) {
    console.log("This is undefined");
}

if (!NaN) {
    console.log("This is NaN");
}
```

In summary, falsy values are those that evaluate to false in a Boolean context, and they can lead to unexpected behavior if not properly understood.
